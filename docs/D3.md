# D3 Chart Documentation

## Overview

The Chart component uses three core D3 modules:

1. **Scales**, which are functions that map values from an input domain to an output range.
2. **Axes**, which are visual components that use the Scales to draw axis lines, tick marks, and text to the SVG.
3. **Lines**, which are visual components that use the Scales to plot the data on the SVG.

We also use D3 to:

* **Directly manipulate SVG nodes** (e.g. selecting, adding, removing, and appending custom attributes)
* **Animate smooth transitions**

If you're interested in improving your D3 fundamentals, I strongly recommend you check out [Scott Murray's D3 tutorials](http://alignedleft.com/tutorials/d3).

## Scales

Scales are functions that map from an input domain to an output range. For example a very basic scale could be something like `input => input * 2`. This would map the domain [0, 2, 5] to [0, 4, 10].

We can create a basic Scale with `d3.scale.linear()`, and a more specific Time Scale with `d3.time.scale()`.

The Time Scale extends the basic D3 Linear Scale, and customizes it to format the return value as a date. It also has special methods, such as `ticks()`, which make it easy to customize the output range for a time-based domain. From the docs:

> ...the time scale also provides suitable ticks based on time intervals, taking the pain out of generating axes for nearly any time-based domain.

* [D3 docs: Linear Scale](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Quantitative-Scales#linear)
* [D3 docs: Time scale](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Time-Scales)
* [Scott Murray: Scales](http://alignedleft.com/tutorials/d3/scales)

### scale.domain()

The previous example of a Scale function was very simplistic. D3 Scales take the _input domain_ and the _output range_ into account, so that they map a value from a domain of values to a range of values.

We can refine a Scale by defining the valid input domain. This defines the minimum and maximum values that can be passed in.

* [D3 docs: domain()](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Time-Scales#domain)

### scale.range()

We can refine a Scale by defining the valid output range. This is the minimum value it can return and the maximum value it can return.

* [D3 docs: range()](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Time-Scales#range)

## Axes

By calling `d3.axis()`, we instantiate a special D3 component that works specifically with Scales. It represents a Scale's output as lines and text drawn to an SVG. This component is a function that accepts a selection. When called, it will apply the axis to the selection.

* [D3 docs: Axis](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/SVG-Axes)
* [Scott Murray: Axes](http://alignedleft.com/tutorials/d3/axes)

### axis.scale()

Set the scale that the axis will use to generate and draw its tick marks.

* [D3 docs: scale()](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/SVG-Axes#scale)

### axis.ticks()

Specify the format for the tick mark text. This is passed on to the Axis's Scale via [scale.ticks()](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Time-Scales#ticks).

* [D3 docs: ticks()](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/SVG-Axes#ticks)

### axis.tickSize()

This accepts _inner_ and _outer_ values. The inner value determines how many pixels long the tick mark is. Setting the outer value to 0 renders the tick mark as a [straight line](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/SVG-Axes#outerTickSize).

* [D3 docs: tickSize()](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/SVG-Axes#tickSize)
* [D3 docs: innerTickSize()](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/SVG-Axes#innerTickSize)
* [D3 docs: outerTickSize()](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/SVG-Axes#outerTickSize)

### axis.orient()

Positions the axis at the top, bottom, left, or right of the SVG.

Because we want our chart's y-axis tick marks to extend the entire width of the screen, we need to get creative with this by positioning the axis on the right, settings its tick size to be the full width of the SVG, and then translating the tick mark labels to the left side. This is similar to [this example from the D3 docs](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3371592).

* [D3 docs: orient()](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/SVG-Axes#orient)

## Line

D3 provides a robust interface for building SVG shapes. It lets you create shapes directly, but you can also use _shape generators_, which are object/functions that let you customize how path data is generated from input data.

For our chart, we call `d3.svg.line()` to create a [line generator](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/SVG-Shapes#line).

### line.interpolate()

This will specify a method for interpolating the values between the data points in our input data. For example, you could specify a method that draws the chart to appear [discrete or continuous](http://www.usablestats.com/lessons/datatypes2). In our case, we specify the "basis" method, which draws the line as a [B-spline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-spline).

* [D3 docs: interpolate()](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/SVG-Shapes#line_interpolate)

### line.x()

This method lets you specify a function for mapping an input data source to an x output value. This output value will then be passed through the x Scale function when D3 draws our line chart.

* [D3 docs: x()](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/SVG-Shapes#line_x)

### line.y()

This method is the same as the `x()` method, except it is used for calculating the y positions of the points on our chart's line.

* [D3 docs: y()](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/SVG-Shapes#line_y)

## SVG manipulation

### d3.selectAll()

This method lets you select a bunch of elements and make changes to them without needing a for-loop. Conceptually, it works like jQuery's `$()` method.

You might notice that a lot of times it looks like we're calling `selectAll()` on nodes which don't exist yet. When this happens, the method returns what's called an "empty selection". It represents elements which will exist, but don't exist yet. [See Scott Murray's explanation for more info](http://alignedleft.com/tutorials/d3/binding-data). For an even more in-depth explanation on how selections work, [here's one from Mike Bostock](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/selection/).

* [D3 docs: selectAll()](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Selections#d3_selectAll)

### selection.data()

This binds the specified array of input data with the current selection. That means that when we call methods that perform operations on a selection, we'll have access to the data element associated with each node in the selection.

* [D3 docs: data()](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Selections#data)
* [Scott Murray: Binding data](http://alignedleft.com/tutorials/d3/binding-data)
* [Mike Bostock: Data joins](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/join/)
* [Mike Bostock: Bound to data](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/selection/#data)

### selection.enter()

This method returns a selection of placeholder nodes for each data element for which no corresponding DOM node could be found in the current selection. From the D3 docs:

> ...the enter selection only defines the append, insert, select and call operators; you must use these operators to instantiate the entering elements before modifying any content

* [D3 docs: enter()](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Selections#enter)
* [Scott Becker: Enter and exit](http://synthesis.sbecker.net/articles/2012/07/09/learning-d3-part-2)

### selection.exit()

This returns a selection of existing DOM nodes in the current selection for which no corresponding data element was found. This means we have leftover nodes which don't match up with our data set, so we generally want to delete them by calling `remove()`.

* [D3 docs: exit()](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Selections#exit)
* [Scott Becker: Enter and exit](http://synthesis.sbecker.net/articles/2012/07/09/learning-d3-part-2)

### selection.append()

Appends a new element to the selection.

* [D3 docs: append()](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Selections#append)

### selection.insert()

Inserts a new element to the selection, before the element with the matching selector.

* [D3 docs: insert()](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Selections#insert)

### selection.remove()

Removes the current selection from the document.

* [D3 docs: remove()](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Selections#remove)

### selection.attr()

Sets an SVG attribute name and value on the selected elements. We mostly use this for setting `class`, though sometimes we also set the `d` attribute. This SVG attribute [defines a path to follow](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/d). As a useful feature, D3 lets us supply a mapping function as the value for this attribute. D3 will then evaluate the function and translate the return values into a string format which can be applied to the SVG element(s).

* [D3 docs: attr()](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Selections#attr)

### selection.call()

This method accepts a function, which will be called with the selection as the first argument. It's a way to encapsulate logic for styling and customizing selections.

* [D3 docs: call()](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Selections#call)

### selection.style()

Sets the CSS style on the supplied element. If the supplied value is a function, D3 will evaluate it before applying it.

* [D3 docs: style()](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Selections#style)

## Transitions

### selection.transition()

This method begins a transition on the current selection and returns a [transition object](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Transitions#transition).

* [D3 docs: transition()](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Selections#transition)
* [D3 docs: Transition object](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Transitions)

### transition.duration()

Specifies a transition duration in milliseconds.

* [D3 docs: duration()](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Transitions#duration)

### transition.tween()

Specify the tweening function to be used for transitioning specific properties of a selection's elements. In our code, we specify a null value for tweening the `attr.dx` property,

* [D3 docs: tween()](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Transitions#tween)
